# Question:
# Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
# Then, the output should be:
# again and hello makes perfect practice world

# Hints:
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
# We use set container to remove duplicated data automatically and then use sorted() to sort the data.

words = raw_input("Enter sequence of words separated by whitespace: ").split(' ')
words_set = set(words)
print ' '.join(sorted(words_set))
print words_set
